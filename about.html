                <p>Pilates is a great workout for women of all ages. It can help to build strength, 
                flexibility and endurance. It can also help to improve posture and alleviate back pain.

                        It is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity of your 
                        workouts as your pregnancy progresses. Always consult with your doctor before starting

                    <p>Hotroom pilates is a great way to get your sweat on and improve your fitness 
                        at the same time. This type of pilates is done in a room that is heated to 
                        around 80-85 degrees, which makes for a great workout. Not only does the heat 
                        help you to sweat more, but it also helps to loosen up your muscles and make them more 
                        pliable. This makes hotroom pilates an excellent choice for those who are looking to improve 
                        their flexibility and range of motion</p>
